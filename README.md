# Croptopia-Fabric

This is a fabric-only maintenance fork of Thonk's excellent mod, Croptopia:

https://github.com/ExcessiveAmountsOfZombies/Croptopia

I'm just keeping it up-to-date with the latest minecraft versions for now
until updated offical releases are available.


## Notes

* **THIS MIGHT HAVE BUGS.** I didn't write this mod; I'm just keeping it
up-to-date with the latest minecraft builds.  I might have made a mistake so
test it on a backup world first.  Caveat Emptor.
* I mainly built this for myself because I wanted to upgrade my server
and Croptopia was the last must-have mod that wasn't getting updating.
* The forge version does not build.  I lack the time and expertise to
also maintain that version.
* The guide book is going to be broken until Patchouli gets an update.
